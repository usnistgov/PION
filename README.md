# PION: Password-based IoT Onboarding Over Named Data Networking

This library implements a secure device onboarding protocol for Named Data Networking using SPAKE2 and NDNCERT.
It contains three components corresponding to the roles defined in the protocol: device, authenticator, certificate authority.

This software is developed at the [Communications Technology Laboratory](https://www.nist.gov/ctl) of the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/).
It is in pre-release stage and will continue to be updated.
